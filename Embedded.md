## ve1l3d_str1ng5:
To be frank, this was an easiest task, I have done. As it was just to find the flag by typing characters to find the position of the character in the flag. from this i learnt about arduino.
## Circuit Sl3uth 1:
This is the basic thing which i have domr i.e to find the swtiches that should have to be switched on to make the LED passing the gates.
## Circuit Sl3uth 2:
This is also same as the second but we need to find the switches that should be turned off the make the LED glow.
## Mystery Maze:
this was an interesting task that the hardware given was to play a game using arduino software to collect the letters in the flaf to get the flag but it was challenging as it teleports when approaching the letter
## http_request:
in this challenge we have to connect the wifi ie is provided to find the ip address and use that ip address to browse the net for flag using the command
## AT:
for this a hardware is given and we are given a hint. use should use the at commands to find the given hint
## L05t-With1n_R0bots
in this they have given a wifi to connect and find the ip address and the hint is given that for address of website it is present in the name of the challenge itself and used the ip address with robots.txt and used the find command to find the flag
