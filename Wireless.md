## what's_up_DoH:
in this a hint was given i.e idk567 and a pcap file which is opened using wireshark. using find function, the string "idk567" was searched and a website is found and the name of the website is the flag.
## Is_It_Secure_Tho??
In this also a pcap file was given and there was a hint that the info was leaked so i sorted the unencrypted protocols and in that the post file was taken. in that the flag was present.
